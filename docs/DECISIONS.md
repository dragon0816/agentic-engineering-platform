# Architecture decisions

## 2026-10-02 — Incremental backend boundary before native Agent execution

Decision: Keep the existing Gateway as the sole task-capable backend in the
first slice. Introduce a typed backend profile and exact-selection router
around its conversation path. A Model backend uses the AEP harness and existing
Bridge policy; future native Agent backends own their internal loop and must
pass a separate data-policy and containment gate. Backend health describes
observed readiness, not execution permission. Selection never silently falls
back to another backend.

Reason: This preserves deterministic Workflow behavior and provides a small
regression boundary before changing data trust, CLI execution or completion
validation. Replacing Gateway and CLI paths together was rejected because it
would combine several security and migration risks. Web-only classification was
rejected because it would leave other ingresses unprotected.

## 2026-10-02 — Initial backend data rule

Decision: Unclassified data may use only a suitably approved internal Gateway.
Native Codex/Claude Code may receive a task only when the entire context sent
to them is explicitly classified `PUBLIC`. No Gateway outage or backend
availability change can weaken this rule. This is the owner's explicit choice;
implementation and denial tests belong to the next data-policy slice.

Reason: The existing local CLI text-chat path has no classification or
governed tool boundary. Treating it as a native AEP task backend would expose
unreviewed context and side effects. Pausing all unclassified work was
considered but rejected by the owner in favor of the approved internal Gateway.
